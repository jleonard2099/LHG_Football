#### SIDENOTE: Do any of these fall into the "Issues" realm? If so, create GitHub issue items ####

[ ] Punting
how high is the punter's average?
if that would take them into the endzone, they're obviously going to attempt a coffin corner
there needs to be a % chance of success associated with that
when successful, it goes OB or stops rolling
the ball position there should be inside the 10 ???

[ ] Challenges
	give player option to challenge plays
	how frequent to make it possible?
	track # allowed 
	be sure to penalize

[ ] New overtime rules

[ ] All penalty types
Penalty yardage changes over time
	
[ ] Integrate team file selection, stat file name functions
- College BB already has "STATCONVERT" subroutine
- Team file functions already built, just not tested

[ ] Condense similar subroutines
- Menu / box routines
- QB ratings / calculations

[ ] Change Pro to support 4 divisions not just 3

[ ] Stats Considerations
- "Does this team have saved stats"??? - update to just detect it!!!
- View Standings - doesn't confirm it's pro / college

[ ] AutoPlay global variable
- If AP=1 and u5 = 6 or u5...
- Use this conditional once to set a flag
	- Use that flag later in the game to make decisions
	- Give the flag a user-friendly name like silentPBP

[ ] Update RECORDS file(s) using real-world data
