## Revised Play-by-Play Approach ##

- INCLUDE a pre-snap PBP x% of the time
	- Montana lines up in shotgun
	- Brady is staring down a 4 LB formation
	- New England lines up with 4 wide outs

- Use the following general format
[Position/player] [action] [direction] [Gain/Loss text or sentence]

[defense player] [action - stop, tackle, int, etc]

- Incorporate a yard line indicator

- Make sure passing directions != running directions

- Some examples:
	- Montana fires over the middle
	- Brady throws deep toward the sideline
	- Caught by Rice, who makes it to the xxx
	- Payton rushes to the outside. out of bounds at the xxx
	- Reggie White brings him down at the xxx
