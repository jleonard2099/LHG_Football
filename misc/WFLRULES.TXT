The WFL had these 11 rule changes :
        1) Kickoffs at the 30 yard line;
        2) Goal posts moved to the back of the end zone;
        3) Returning of missed field goals to the line of scrimmage,
           except when inside the 20 yard line;
        4) Touchdowns were worth 7 points;
        5) The "action point" (the two point conversion) used after
           all TD's - no extra point kicks;
        6) Receivers needed only one foot inbounds for a completion;
        7) A 15 minute overtime period for ties;
        8) No fair catches on punt returns;
        9) Offensive backs were permitted in motion toward the line
           of scrimmage before the snap;
       10) The hash marks were moved inward; 
       11) Incomplete passes inside the 2 yard line were returned to
           the line of scrimmage.
